# Conventional Commit Message Formats (Best Practice)

```<type>(<optional scope>): <description>```

```<optional body>```

```<optional footer>```

## Some basic examples:

•	Feature (adding a new feature – registration form)

```feature: added registration form```

```This feature adds a registration form for the user to input their user details for registration purposes.```

----------

•	Bugfix (for bug fixes)

```fix: set email field as mandatory```

```Set email field as a mandatory field to prevent users from registering without one```

----------

•	Documentation (affecting documentation only)

```docs: added user guide v1.0.0```

```Added a user guide on how to use the basic features of application.```
